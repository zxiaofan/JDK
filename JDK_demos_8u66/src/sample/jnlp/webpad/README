WebPad Application Version 1.0.

Brief Description :

This simple word processing application allows users to Create, Open,
Modify, Save and Print files. Webpad application uses the following 
JNLP API extensively to access resources locally even when running
in the untrusted execution environment. 

FileOpenService : openFileDialog will allow the user to choose a single
file. Contents of the selected file is returned as a FileContents object.

FileContent : This object encapsulates the name and contents of a file. 
It provides many methods to access information related to its contents.

FileSaveService : This allows the user to save a file to the local file
using its methods saveFileDialog() and saveAsFileDialog().

ClipboardService : Methods getContents() and setContents() are used for 
accessing the contents of shared system-wide clipboard.
 
PrintService : This provides methods for access to printing functions.

DownloadService : This allows application to determine if its resources
are cached and to force resources to be cached. It also pops up a progress
window which updates the status as the load progresses.

BasicService : The BasicService interface provides access to the codebase
of the application and directs browser on the client to show the given URL.  

PersistenceService: This interface provides methods for storing data 
locally on the client system, somewhat similar to cookie mechanism.
This current README file is a implementation of PersistenceService API. 
Similarly whatever valid contents existed in the text area of WebPad before
exiting will be displayed when the application is restarted next time.


Publish and Show options under the menu Web allows users to publish the
contents of the textarea to the web server. Show displays the published
content inside the browser. This is implemented using Servlets.
Help subsystem is also supported by Webpad application.

Java Web Start is launched automatically by browser when the user clicks on 
a link which is associated with a JNLP file. It then downloads and caches the
webpad application on the local client machine where browser is running.
This cached application when invoked next time is already downloaded and
runs as fast as a traditionally installed application.By default applications
are run in a protective environment (sandbox) with restricted access to 
local disk and network resources. 

Java Web Start only transfers JAR files from the Web server to the location
determined by it on the client machine. Thus, an application cannot use 
disk-relative references to resources such as images and configuration files.
To achieve this, we used ClassLoader.getResource() API to access any resource
file inside the JAR files.  

To provide a simple and convenient packaging format of Applications, Java
Web Start includes a servlet in the developer's pack. The name of the servlet
is JnlpDownloadServlet and is packaged into the jnlp-servlet.jar file. This
servlet eases deployment of application on any J2EE-complaint application
server by packing a JNLP files and its associated resources in a Web Archive
(.war) file. Java Web Start also supports version based download of
applications as illustrated in the webpad demo. For each resource (jar files)
in the .jnlp file, version number can be specified. Version numbers can
be associated on a per-file basis or can be described in the the version.xml 
file on a per-directory basis.

Files :

src       - This directory has all the required source files. To
            demonstrate how version based deployment of applications
            can be done, we are assuming that this is version 1.
            version1 directory has complete source (.java) files
            required for developing WebPad application. servlet 
            directory has sources required for demonstrating Publish
            and Show features of WebPad app.

lib       - This directory will contain the generated txtservlet.jar
	    and webpad.jar

class     - This directory containing .class files is generated
            by the build process. README file here is opened by
            default by the WebPad application. It is maintained
            here so that it gets archived into JAR files, so 
            please maintain a copy of README file in this dir.

war       - This directory contains all the files required for 
            deploying a web based application. Application related 
            .jnlp files and .jar files are inside app. webpad.jnlp 
            and javahelp.jnlp files are used in this application.
            jlfgr-1.0.jar is the standard Java L&F icons. 
            jh.jar and holidays.jar are part of JavaHelp 1.1.
            jhcore.jar is a tiny file that gets downloaded eagerly
            by JWS leaving the bigger jh.jar and holidays.jar file
            on the server. JWS will always download atleast one JAR 
            resource eagerly from any JNLP file. All these JAR
            files have version numbers associated with it except the
            webpad.jar file which is specified in version.xml file.  

Building & Deployment of Application :

1) Build .class and .jar files by running
  
   gnumake

   in the directory where GNUmakefile file resides.

   The following environment variable must be set:

   # environment variable CLASS_PATH should contain path to javaws.jar, servlet.jar and jh.jar 
   # environment variable FILE_SEPARATOR variable for file separator (; on win32 and : on unix)
   # environment variable SDK_HOME should point to SDK directory

   If you are running on windows platform, it also assume you have MKS Toolkit installed and it is in your path environment variable.  (We need commands like cp, echo, mkdir, rm)  

   The generated classes will go to the classes directory, and the resulting jar files will be in the lib directory by default.  You can adjust the output directory to anything you want by changing the GNUmakefile.



2) To ease the deployment of application to on any J2EE-complaint 
   server all the resources required including .jnlp and jar files
   are packed into a Web Archive (.war) file.

   Please put the following files into the war directory:

   war/WEB-INF/lib/jnlp-servlet.jar (from building the JNLPDownloadServlet)
   war/WEB-INF/lib/txtservlet.jar (generated in the lib directory)
   war/WEB-INF/lib/<jar files for XML parser> (not needed if servlet container is running J2SE 1.4+; or if the servlet container already comes with a XML parser in it)
   war/app/jh__V1.0.jar (rename from jh.jar)
   war/app/webpad.jar (generated in the lib directory)
   
   To build .war file, run below command inside the war directory

   jar -cvf ../webpad.war .

3) Copy webpad.war file generated to the your web server directory.
   For Tomcat server, copy webpad.war file to
   $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps directory and restart the web server.
