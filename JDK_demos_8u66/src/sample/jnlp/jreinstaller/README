JavaWebStart JRE 1.4.2 auto-download installer sample
-----------------------------------------------------

Brief Description :

This sample is the Java Web Start JRE auto-download installer.  You can specify
this installer in your application's JNLP file.  Then, when your JNLP
application is loaded by a client, if the required JRE is not on the client
machine, this installer will be used to auto-download the JRE to the client
machine.

Files :

build	- This directory contains all the necessary files for building your
          application
src	- This directory contains the source code for the sample
          installer

Building and Deployment of installer :

To build on a specific platform, go to:

jreinstaller/build/<platform>/jreinstallers

and do a:

gnumake -e SDK_12=<path to sdk directory> \
        -e JNLP_JAR=<path to jnlp.jar/javaws.jar> \
        -e J2RE_BIN=<path to the 1.4.2 jre installer executable> \
        -e J2RE_LICENSE=<path to the jre installer license,
			e.g LICENSE file located in jre directory> \
        -e SIGNING=<true if you want to sign the jars> \
        -e CACERTS=<path to keystore location for jar signing> \
        -e PASSWD=<password for keystore integrity> \
        -e ALIAS=<keystore alias>

For information on how to generate self-signed certificates for testing 
purpose, see:
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws/developersguide/development.html#signing

The resulting jar files will be generated in:

jreinstaller/build/<platform>/jreinstallers/bin/

The jnlp file for the installer can be found at:

jreinstaller/build/<platform>/jreinstallers/resources/

You will need to host the installer using the JNLPDownloadServlet and the
VersionDownload Protocol.  Please refer to the JNLPDownloadServlet guide for
more details:

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws/developersguide/development.html

The "javaVersion" property in the JREInstaller jnlp file will be the version of
the JRE. It must match the <version-id> tag (specified in the version.xml file)
for  the jnlp file of the JREInstaller.

There is a sample version.xml and a sample jnlp file for the JREInstaller in
the directory jreinstaller/build/<platform>/jreinstallers/resources/.

On Windows platform, the installer will install the JRE into the default
location, "c:\program files\java\j2re1.4.2"

On Solaris/Linux, the installer will install the JRE into the user's
javawebstart cache.

In order for your application to use this JREInstaller, you will need to set
the j2se href tag in the application's jnlp file to point to the URL where you
host the installer.  For example, if your JREInstaller jnlp file is located at
http://somehost.com/142installer/javaws-1_0_1-j2re-1_4_2-windows-i586.jnlp, 
then the j2se href tag in your application should point to 
"http://somehost.com/142installer".
