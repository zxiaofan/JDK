  <i>Ebay</i> Example</center></h1>
  
  <h2><a name="h2-Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
  <ul>
  <p>The Webservices <i>Ebay</i> example is an application that shows how to use 
  the JAX-WS API. The example shows how to access Ebay services via their
  web service interface. To use this sample you must first register with Ebay 
  and get the <code>appId, certId, devId and authToken </code> and put the 
  appropriate values in the <code>ebay.properties</code> file. You can register 
  at <a href="http://developer.ebay.com/developercenter/soap/">
  http://developer.ebay.com/developercenter/soap/</a> to get the keys. It is recommended
  to use the sandbox environment provided by Ebay to run the sample. First you 
  need to create and validate a sandbox test account and then generate a 
  single user authentication token. Also note at the time this sample was 
  written and tested the version of <code>eBaySvc.wsdl</code> was 455. For 
  convinience the wsdl file is bundled.

  <p>The JAX-WS <i>Ebay</i> example does not however implement
     the full fledged logic that such an application might
     have. It implements a subset of this logic which is
     sufficient to demonstrate common patterns and
     solutions used when implementing a web service and
     interface for an application with JAX-WS Technology.</p>

    <ul>
        <p>Before reading further, you will need to generate the 
        Java Documentation for the example's sources.</p> The example has two 
        parts to it - the client and the server. In the sample root directory 
        there are two directories - <code>EbayClient</code>
        and <code>EbayServer</code>. Run the following command in both the 
        directories
        <pre>ant</pre>
        </p>
        <p>Alternatively you can open the <code>EbayClient</code> and 
        <code>EbayServer</code> project with the 
           NetBeans IDE and generate the Javadoc from its <code>Build</code>
           menu.

  <h2><a name="h2-Overview">Overview of the <i>Ebay</i> Example</a></h2>
  
  <ul>
      The Ebay sample has two parts to it - EbayClient and the EbayServer.
      <ul>
          <li>
              EbayClient demonstrates how you can use a webservice client to 
              access an ebay service - in this case to lookup an item based
              on the item id. The client uses the <code>eBaySvc.wsdl</code> file 
              to generate stubs and proxy classes by running the 
              <code>wsimport</code> tool in the <code>ebay.apis</code> package 
              that it then uses in the application to make calls to either the 
              Ebay site or to the local server. The <code>MainGUIApp</code> class 
              in the <code>ebay.client</code> package is the main class to run 
              the example. The application is a  swing application that lets 
              you select which server to query and also set
              preferences for http proxy incase you are behind a firewall.
              There is also a JAX-WS handler in the <code>ebay.client.handler</code>
              package - <code>RequesterCredentials</code>. The Ebay wsdl uses
              additional headers that is defined in the binding section of the 
              WSDL. This concept is currently not supported by the JAX-WS 
              implementation and hence we insert the additional header using 
              a JAX-WS protocol handler. We use the <code>RequesterCredentials</code>
              handler to get access to the entire soap message and then add the 
              required soap headers to query the ebay web service.
              <blockquote>
              Note: When building the application you will see a lot of warnings
              like 
              <pre>[exec] warning: cos-nonambig: "urn:ebay:apis:eBLBaseComponents"
              :eBayAuthToken and WC[##any] (or elements from their substitution 
              group) violate "Unique Particle Attribution". During validation 
              against this schema, ambiguity would be created for those two 
              particles</pre> when the <code>wsimport</code> tool is being executed. 
              This is because the ebay wsdl has schema definitions that cause these 
              warnings to be generated. Note however the example will run just fine.

          <li>
              EbayServer demonstrates how you can build a service like ebay starting 
              from a wsdl. In general though the recommended practice for building 
              a service is to start from Java and use annotations to define the 
              service and then use that service to generate a wsdl file for clients
              to use. However in this case since there might be a need to be 
              able to access the service locally in the sample we are using the
              same wsdl to show how you can build the service as well.  
              The <code>eBaySvc.wsdl</code> file is used to 
              to generate stubs and proxy classes by running the 
              <code>wsimport</code> tool in the <code>ebay.apis</code> package 
              that it then uses in the server side application to serve up 
              requests. The example uses the Java SE 6 light weight web server
              to host the endpoint. The <code>Ebay</code> class in the 
              <code>ebay.server</code> package is the class that contains the 
              item information. Note for the purpose of the example we have 
              used a <code>HashMap</code> to store the information. The server
              side example also demonstrates how you can use JAX-WS for REST
              based web services. In Java SE 6 the web server does not have 
              the capability to serve files from the file system. So we have 
              implemented the <code>ImageProvider</code> service to serve up 
              images using the REST style web services. The <code>Main</code>
              class is the main class of the application that starts up the 
              two endpoints to serve up the requests. When using the client with
              the local server at this time the item id values supported are 
              <code>1 or 9720685987, 2 or 9723025228, 3 or 9722594617 </code>

        To run the client you need to be in the <code>EbayClient</code> directory
        and execute the following commands:
        <p>
        <pre>ant run</pre>
        </p>
        
        </p>
        <p>Alternatively you can open the <code>EbayClient</code> project with the 
           NetBeans IDE and right click on the <code>EbayClient</code> project 
           and select <code>Run project</code>
           
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <u>Note:</u> You can also run the <i>EbayClient</i> 
            application directly from the <code>java</code> 
            command line. Make sure to build the EbayClient jar
            first. 
            <br>On Unix systems:
            <pre>ant jar
cd dist
java -jar EbayClient.jar</pre>

            <p><code>ant jar<br>
cd dist
java -jar EbayClient.jar</code></p>

        If you want to run the <code>EbayServer</code> so that you can access
        the server side functionality as well on the local machine then you 
        need to be in the <code>EbayServer</code> directory and execute the 
        following commands:
        <p>
        <pre>ant run</pre>
        </p>

    <ul>
    <p>
        In this document, we have presented an advanced 
        JAX-WS example. We have shown how you can build a client to access
        a web service starting from a WSDL file. We have also demonstrated
        how to use <code>Handler</code> in the client to add additional
        information to messages. We have also demonstrated how to build a service
        for a corresponding wsdl and how to enable REST services using JAX-WS.
