 * given in <A HREF=example.html>example.html</A>, by default located in the
 * same directory as this source file ($DERBY_HOME/demo/programs/simple/).</p>
 * <p>
 * Derby applications can run against Derby running in an embedded
 * or a client/server framework.</p>
 * <p>
 * When Derby runs in an embedded framework, the JDBC application and Derby
 * run in the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The application
 * starts up the Derby engine.</p>
 * <p>
 * When Derby runs in a client/server framework, the application runs in a
 * different JVM from Derby. The connectivity framework (in this case the Derby
 * Network Server) provides network connections. The client driver is loaded
 * automatically.</p>
